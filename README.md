# EE2026-Digital Design Project
This repository contains the codes (under the 'final' branch) for the design of an integrated sight and sound entertainment system on the Basys3 FPGA Board with a microphone and an OLED screen. This project was carried out for the module EE2026 on digital design. The report pdf file under this branch contains a detailed description of the functionalities of our system. The codes were written in Verilog, a hardware description language.  
The main module is the Top_Student module, with all the other modules for the various games and functionalities instantiated within it.
